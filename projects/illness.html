    <h1>Chronic illness</h1>

    <p>
      A chronic or long-term illness means having to adjust to the demands of
      the illness and the therapy used to treat the condition. <br /> There may be
      additional stresses, since chronic illness might change the way you live,
      see yourself and relate to others.
      <br /><br />
      Chronic illnesses are mostly characterised by: 
      <ul>
        <li>-complex causes</li>
        <li>-many risk factors</li>
        <li>-long latency periods</li>
        <li>-a long illness</li>
        <li>-functional impairment or disability</li>
      </ul> 
      Most chronic illnesses do not fix themselves and are generally
      not cured completely. <br />Some can be immediately life-threatening, such as
      heart disease and stroke. <br />Others linger over time and need intensive
      management, such as diabetes. <br />Most chronic illnesses persist throughout a
      person's life, but are not always the cause of death, such as arthritis.
